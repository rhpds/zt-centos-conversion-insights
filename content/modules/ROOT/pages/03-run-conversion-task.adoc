== Checking the status of the task

Just as in the first challenge of this lab, there are 2 ways to check on
the status of the task. The first is to read the `+convert2rhel+` logs
on the `+centos+` host. The second is to view the status of the task in
Insights.

To view the `+convert2rhel+` logs, enter the following in the cli of the
`+centos+` host.

[source,bash,run]

tail -f /var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log

To view the status of the task in Insights, click on the `+Activity+`
tab.

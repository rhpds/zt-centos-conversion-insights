== Fix the inhibitors

This CentOS host has a very basic configuration and is easily remediated
with an update. Go back into the `+centos+` tab to access the terminal.

Update the host and reboot. Rebooting is required to load the updated
kernel.

[source,bash,run]
----
yum update -y && reboot
----

.update and reboot

The terminal will lose connection with the centos host leaving the
message `+exited+`.

.exited

Reconnect to the session in the `+centos+` tab. Refresh the `+centos+`
tab until you are reconnected.

.refresh

You may now proceed to the next challenge or you may perform the
optional step below to re-run the pre-conversion.

== Optional: rerun the the pre-conversion task to check that the conversion can proceed

Once reconnected go back into the virtual browser. Click on
`+Run task again+`.

.run task again

A new task will be created. image:../assets/newtask.png[new task]

When it completes, the report will tell you that the system is ready for
conversion.
